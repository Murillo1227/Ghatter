[00:17.53] Telling myself, \"I won't go there\"
[00:21.26] Oh, but I know that I won't care
[00:24.76] Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
[00:31.99] This lust is a burden that we both share
[00:35.62] Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
[00:39.28] Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt
[00:46.28] (Ooh)
[00:47.76] There's darkness in the distance
[00:51.33] From the way that I've been livin' (ooh)
[00:55.13] But I know I can't resist it
[00:58.96] 
[01:01.34] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[01:05.17] You and I drink the poison from the same vine
[01:08.95] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[01:12.59] Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
[01:16.18] From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
[01:19.83] From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
[01:23.46] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[01:28.42] 
[01:31.30] Tellin' myself it's the last time
[01:34.77] Can you spare any mercy that you might find
[01:39.18] If I'm down on my knees again
[01:45.61] Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
[01:49.57] Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
[01:53.30] Please, don't leave me in the end
[02:00.15] (Ooh)
[02:01.74] There's darkness in the distance
[02:05.25] I'm begging for forgiveness (ooh)
[02:08.87] But I know I might resist it, oh
[02:15.17] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[02:18.95] You and I drink the poison from the same vine
[02:22.47] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[02:26.07] Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
[02:29.88] From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
[02:33.43] From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
[02:37.53] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[02:44.68] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[02:48.46] You and I drink the poison from the same vine
[02:52.02] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[02:55.87] Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
[02:59.42] From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
[03:03.06] From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
[03:07.00] Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
[03:11.47]
